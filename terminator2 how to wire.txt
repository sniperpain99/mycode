Arduino to L298N Connections:
Arduino Pin 2 to L298N IN1 (controls left motor forward)
Arduino Pin 3 to L298N IN2 (controls left motor backward)
Arduino Pin 4 to L298N IN3 (controls right motor forward)
Arduino Pin 5 to L298N IN4 (controls right motor backward)

L298N to Motor Connections:
Connect the left motor to L298N OUT1 and OUT2
Connect the right motor to L298N OUT3 and OUT4

Power Connections:
*leave the power jumper enabled for 7-12V input for the motor controller*
*don't use the 5VC out on the L298N to Arduino, because the
Arduino will be powered by the USB cable.*

Connect the 12V power supply positive to L298N VCC
Connect the 12V power supply ground to L298N GND and to the Arduino GND
